# EmployeeChurn

## Introducion
The main objective of this project is to create a predictive model that will be able to predict employee churn as accurate as possible using various attributes associated with employees. 
Predicting employee churn offers invaluable advantages to organizations. It enables them to proactively implement retention strategies, addressing issues that may prompt employees to leave. 
This approach not only retains valuable talent but is also likely more cost-effective than recruiting and training new employees. 
To prepare for the data modeling process, I will go through the steps for data cleaning, data exploration, and data preparation in order to prepare the data for modeling. Various methods
and changes will occur throughout to adjust for better performance of the model. I will then go through the results of the model and evaluate the modelâ€™s performance to determine the success of 
the model as well as any next steps.
