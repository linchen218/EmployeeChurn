# EmployeeChurn

## Introduction
The main objective of this project is to create a predictive model that will be able to predict employee churn as accurate as possible using various attributes associated with employees. 
Predicting employee churn offers invaluable advantages to organizations. It enables them to proactively implement retention strategies, addressing issues that may prompt employees to leave. 
This approach not only retains valuable talent but is also likely more cost-effective than recruiting and training new employees. 
To prepare for the data modeling process, I will go through the steps for data cleaning, data exploration, and data preparation in order to prepare the data for modeling. Various methods
and changes will occur throughout to adjust for better performance of the model. I will then go through the results of the model and evaluate the modelâ€™s performance to determine the success of 
the model as well as any next steps.

## Methods
* Data Cleaning
* EDA
* Predictive Modeling
  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree
  * kNN
* Evaluation

To start off, the dataset will be cleaned to address any potential NAs before moving into the Exploratory Data Analysis step of the project. This step is crucial as it is important to
understand what type of data we are looking at and the distribution of the variables and find hidden patterns. During this stage, we will also be preparing the data for modeling. I am sure that I will be going back and forth between modeling and this stage based on results or biases that I see in the results. For the modeling stage, I am currently considering a logistic regression, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbor and evaluating the results of the 3 models against each other. I will then go in depth into the performance metrics of the models and recommend the best model for the organization to utilize to predict or prepare for employee attrition/churn.
